-During the game, the character will gain words that the player can type to make the character performs certain actions.
-However, words can be "curse", which means that the player can only type a synonym of that word to get the character to perform the action.
Plus, a certain synonym can only be use a number of time before it needs a cooldown.
-Some word are consumables, meaning that the player can only use them once.
-The player can gain suffixes and prefixes (like "ful" and "less") to make some words more powerful and make other less powerful.
-The game is a "Rogue-like" (first iteration of the game won't be random). The player travels on a map and, similar to "Slay the Spire",
he can either arrive on an enemies case, on an event case or on a shop case. The game end with a boss at the end of the map.
-The combat is turn base. The player goes first, then its the turn of the enemies, and the pattern repeats.

-To attack, the player enters the command "ATTACK", then, a word appears on the screen. The player must enter all the synonym of that word that he knows of the word shown. The more synonym the player can get,
the more damaging his attack will be.
